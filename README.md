### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a computational scientist currently based at Argonne National Lab.
My research focuses on computational frameworks for PDE simulations and distributed computing.

More precisely,
- I have joined the [`mpich` team](https://github.com/pmodels) to help shaping the future of distributed computing
- With other researchers from MIT and UCLouvain we have developed [`murphy`](https://github.com/vanreeslab/murphy) a multiresolution computational framework for 3D PDE simulation with a particular focus on scalability, portability, and maintainability of the code.
- I am also one of the main developer of [`flups`](https://github.com/vortexlab-uclouvain/flups) a distributed FFT code for the unbounded Poisson equation.
