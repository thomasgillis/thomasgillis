### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a computational scientist currently working at MIT and UCLouvain.
My research focuses on computational frameworks for PDE simulations.

More precisely,
- with other researchers we are developing [`murphy`](https://github.com/vanreeslab/murphy) a multiresolution computational framework for 3D PDE simulation.
- we particularly focus on scalability, portability, and maintainability of the code
